                Assignment Scheduler is a project for a web dev class at my school. 
                I have always found it dificult to keep track of my assignments and their deadlines
                to adequately plan what to work on an when. I found that a calendar to put the due date
                or exam date, was difficult to keep track of since i would need to look different amounts
                ahead for different types of work. A hw assignment, i might only need to look a a few days
                ahead, while a project might be 2 weeks, and a quiz a week. thus the goal of this project is to
                allow a user to quickly add events and choose when they should be brought to their attention.
